# Flashcards

Simple flash card desktop application in rust, 
built to get some hands-on experience in Rust and eventually aid my Korean studies.

Using SQLite for storage and the Rust iced crate for the GUI.

Very much a WIP. <br>
Current plan:
* We will keep a SQLite file at the root where words and their translations will be stored
* App should be able to add/remove entries to the DB
* App should be able to page/shuffle through the entries in the DB
